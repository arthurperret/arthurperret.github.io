I set up this website mostly in the hope to get more familiar with jekyll and html. In the meantime, it serves as a place where I can host (mainly) little quantum
computing side projects I've been procrastinating on for way too long.

### Academic life

Currently a physics master student enrolled at the Center for Optics, Photonics and Lasers, in Quebec city, Canada, and affilliated with Université Laval. 
Before that, I did a B.Sc. in Engineering Physics, also at Université Laval.

Quantum optics and quantum information processing is what drives the engineer inside me. The more foundational questions that arise when quantum mechanics is approached
from an information-theoretic point of view is what feeds my endless excursions in phycisist territories.

### Mondane life

Cycling long distance keeps me sane from all that physics rambling. As is trail running.
