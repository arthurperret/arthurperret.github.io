Mainly a list of interesting textbooks, lecture notes, and review articles all things quantum. Some historical and important articles as well. Mainly, the goal is to make a repository
of all the papers I'm always googling when I need them. If that can be useful to others, then it's a plus.

### Textbooks, lecture notes and other *bibles*

#### Quantum computation

 [John Preskill's lecture notes](http://www.theory.caltech.edu/people/preskill/ph229/) : Some says it's the bible by which we should abide. It's also an extremely good 
introduction to the field of quantum information at the graduate level, with a theoretical stance. One of the few that also covers topological quantum computing.

 [Quantum computation and quantum information](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6AEFFEA52D53BE9AE) : The other disputed bible. Written 
 by Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang at the turn of the century. Considered THE introductory textbook for all new comers. A bit outdated however, mostly on the experimental side
 as superconducting qubits aren't mentionned and optical quantum computing was thought to be a dead end at the time. Still, a good resource to get familiar with the concepts.

[Quantum computing for the very curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc) : Not a textbook. Not lecture notes. And geared towards a general audience, albeit with a basis in linear algebra.
Useful for undergrad or anyone remotely interested in quantum computing without getting too much in depth. The [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) approach is interesting by itself.
